;; On one bank of a river are three missionaries (black triangles) and
;; three cannibals (red circles). There is one boat available that can
;; hold up to two people and that they would like to use to cross the
;; river. If the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either
;; of the riverâ€™s banks, the missionaries will get eaten. How can the
;; boat be used to safely carry all the missionaries and cannibals
;; across the river?


;; Try to implement the general search algorithm just described. You
;; can use LIFO and FIFO as queuing strategies to determine the order
;; in which nodes are explored. These two strategies are known as
;; depth-first and breadth-first search respectively. Be careful,
;; depth-first search may descend down infinite branches, so best
;; implement a depth cut-off. Then, extend your implementation with a
;; hash table that stores all the nodes found so far. Print out a
;; trace of the states the algorithm finds (in the order they are
;; discovered) and see how much of the search spaceeach algorithm
;; explores.
